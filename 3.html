	<h2>RPG Games이란 무엇인가</h2>
	<p>
	A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game[1][2] and abbreviated to RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making of character development.[3] Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.[4]
